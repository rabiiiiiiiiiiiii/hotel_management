# hotel_management
project for scd
In our project, on "Hotel Management System", we have tried to show how the 
Data/information in hotels is managed. This is just an overview of management in hotels. 
This has been achieved by dividing the project into various modules. 
Customer can choose the food from the menu and pay for it conveniently. No person is necessary to receive the customer. This autonomous system gives the customer that power to do things on his own with lesser human interaction.
The customer can also choose the quantity of his food and this program allows him/her to book rooms that can be single or double and so on.
